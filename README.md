## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I enjoyed working on this project and gained valuable experience from it. While I completed this project some time ago, I have since learned the importance of commenting my code and using semantic HTML elements. Additionally, designing two distinct share elements for both phone and PC posed a challenge, but I found the JavaScript portion particularly rewarding.


### Continued development

I do not intend to make any further additions to this project as I believe it is complete, and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge by embarking on new projects and honing my abilities.
